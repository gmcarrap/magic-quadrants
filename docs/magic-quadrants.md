# Magic Quadrants Implementation 

A magic square is a square matrix (equal number of rows and columns) where the sum of numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals always equals the same value, known as the magic constant.

The most famous magic square is the Lo Shu Square, which is a 3x3 magic square (3 rows by 3 columns). It is named after an ancient Chinese river and is represented as follows:

                                    4   9   2
                                    3   5   7
                                    8   1   6
In this magic square:

- Each row, column, and both main diagonals sum to 15.
- It is symmetric in that it can be rotated or reflected without changing its magic properties.
- Historically, it has been associated with Chinese cosmology and has significant symbolic and mathematical applications across different cultures.
