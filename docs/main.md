# Service Implementation

The following service has been implemented to calculate the magic squares formed by prime numbers. 

A magic square of size N is a matrix formed by N squares. So that the sum of each row, column and diagonals is equal. The most famous magic square was named “Lo Shu” and has the form:

                                    4   9   2
                                    3   5   7
                                    8   1   6
                    
If we notice, the values of such a magic square contain an arithmetic succession, that is, the difference between the values is always equal.

Because, in order to calculate magic squares formed by prime numbers, we are going to look for those sets of prime numbers of dimension N that fulfill an arithmetic sequence. This is known as the Green and Tao theorem.
