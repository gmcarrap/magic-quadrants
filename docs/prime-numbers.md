# Prime Numbers Calculation

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit. It works by marking multiples of each prime number as it iterates through the list of natural numbers. The unmarked numbers at the end of the process are primes. It's a simple yet powerful algorithm that takes advantage of the fact that multiples of a prime number are always non-prime. This significantly reduces the number of operations needed to identify prime numbers compared to more naive methods. It's a valuable tool in mathematics and computer science for working with prime numbers.
